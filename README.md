## Future Directions

We are continuously working to improve CsharpNumerics and plan to focus on the following areas:

1. **Enhanced Cross-Validation Tools**  
   Improving the numerical and statistical methods for robust model validation.

2. **Expansion of the Physics Module**  
   Adding more advanced physics models and simulations while leveraging the existing linear algebra foundation.

3. **Improved Documentation and Examples**  
   Providing clearer guides, tutorials, and practical examples to make the library more accessible.

4. **Classical Quantum Circuit Simulation**  
   Implementing CPU-based quantum circuit simulations for educational purposes, enabling students and developers to explore quantum algorithms without access to quantum hardware.

Contributions are welcome — see CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

**CsharpNumerics** is a lightweight yet powerful .NET library for numerical computing, machine learning, statistics, and physics simulations — built entirely in pure C#.

It provides a clean, modular API with robust building blocks for scientific and engineering workflows, including:

* **Numerical Analysis** — linear algebra, transforms, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), vector fields, and numerical integration methods
* **Machine Learning** — regression, classification, cross-validation, and reusable pipelines
* **Statistics** — descriptive analytics, probability tools, and interpolation techniques
* **Physics** — classical mechanics, rigid body dynamics, orbital mechanics, and real-time simulation
